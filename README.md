# 🚀 AI-Powered RFP & Technical Document Analyzer

### The Business Problem
Sales Engineers spend 20%+ of their week manually parsing long RFP and Security documents to find specific technical requirements. This manual process delays "Go/No-Go" decisions and increases the risk of missing critical deal-breakers.

### The Solution
A lightweight AI tool built with **Streamlit** and **OpenAI (GPT-4o)** that allows an SE to upload a PDF and ask natural-language questions to extract technical fit data instantly.

### Features
- **Instant Extraction:** Parse 50+ page PDFs in seconds.
- **Context-Aware:** Uses LLM reasoning to find "hidden" requirements.
- **Security-First:** Designed to process documents without training public models (Enterprise API usage).

### How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone [your-repo-link]`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
